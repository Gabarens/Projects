This mini-project is part of SpringBoards Data Science Intensive course, and it follows a few  guidelines.
But what I did, was I found a dataset from Mode Analytics (https://modeanalytics.com/crunchbase/tables/acquisitions) that I pulled and worked on in my Jupyter/iPython Notebook.
The main objective with this mini-project is to create a "Data Story", and this is my go at it.
